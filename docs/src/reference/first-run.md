# First-run messages

The tables list every message `bas` can print between a first `bas auth login` or `bas tui` and the first secret. Each row gives the message as `bas` prints it, what the person most likely meant, and the command to type next. `NAME` stands for the profile name in the message. [Sign in with an access token](../getting-started/first-run.md) describes the first run itself.
