//! The bas credential broker, which `bas broker` starts, and the client that the `bas`
//! commands use to reach it.
//!
//! The broker is the only process that holds the Bitwarden machine token and the raw
//! credentials. It serves an HTTP/1.1 and JSON API on a unix socket, where it identifies
//! each caller by the kernel's peer credentials; an HTTPS proxy on a loopback port that adds
//! a credential to requests for hosts named in the active policy; an ssh-agent that signs
//! with policy keys; and approval pages where a passkey on the phone approves changes. No
//! credential value ever leaves it. Each use, change, and refusal is written to the system
//! journal with `BAS_AUDIT=1`.
//!
//! The crate builds only on Linux. On other systems it is empty.
